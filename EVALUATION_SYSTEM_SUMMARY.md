# 🎓 Student Evaluation System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What Has Been Built

I've created a **complete student evaluation system** that allows instructors to evaluate students and students to view their evaluations in real-time.

---

## 🏗️ Backend Implementation (Laravel)

### 1. Database Tables Created ✅

#### **courses** table
```sql
- id
- course_code (unique)
- course_name
- description
- instructor_id (FK to users)
- semester
- year
- credits
- timestamps
```

#### **enrollments** table
```sql
- id
- course_id (FK to courses)
- student_id (FK to users)
- status (active/completed/dropped)
- timestamps
- UNIQUE constraint on (course_id, student_id)
```

#### **evaluations** table
```sql
- id
- course_id (FK to courses)
- student_id (FK to users)
- instructor_id (FK to users)
- evaluation_type (assignment, quiz, midterm, final, project, participation)
- title
- description
- score
- max_score
- percentage (auto-calculated)
- grade (auto-calculated: A, B+, etc.)
- feedback
- strengths
- areas_for_improvement
- evaluation_date
- timestamps
```

### 2. Models Created ✅

- **Course.php** - With relationships to instructors, students, enrollments, evaluations
- **Enrollment.php** - With relationships to courses and students
- **Evaluation.php** - With automatic grade calculation and relationships
- **User.php** (updated) - Added relationships for courses and evaluations

### 3. Controllers Created ✅

#### **CourseController**
- `index()` - Get all courses (role-based)
- `store()` - Create new course (instructor only)
- `show($id)` - Get specific course details
- `availableStudents($courseId)` - Get students not enrolled in course

#### **EnrollmentController**
- `store()` - Enroll student in course
- `index($courseId)` - Get all enrollments for a course
- `destroy($id)` - Remove student from course

#### **EvaluationController**
- `studentEvaluations()` - Get evaluations for current student
- `instructorEvaluations()` - Get evaluations created by instructor
- `courseEvaluations($courseId)` - Get all evaluations for a course
- `store()` - Create new evaluation
- `update($id)` - Update existing evaluation
- `destroy($id)` - Delete evaluation
- `studentPerformanceSummary($studentId)` - Get performance analytics

### 4. API Routes Created ✅

All routes are protected with `auth:sanctum` middleware:

**Courses:**
- `GET /api/courses` - List courses
- `POST /api/courses` - Create course
- `GET /api/courses/{id}` - Get course details
- `GET /api/courses/{id}/available-students` - Get available students

**Enrollments:**
- `POST /api/enrollments` - Enroll student
- `GET /api/courses/{courseId}/enrollments` - Get enrollments
- `DELETE /api/enrollments/{id}` - Remove enrollment

**Evaluations:**
- `GET /api/evaluations/student` - Get student's evaluations
- `GET /api/evaluations/instructor` - Get instructor's evaluations
- `GET /api/evaluations/course/{courseId}` - Get course evaluations
- `POST /api/evaluations` - Create evaluation
- `PUT /api/evaluations/{id}` - Update evaluation
- `DELETE /api/evaluations/{id}` - Delete evaluation
- `GET /api/evaluations/student/{studentId}/summary` - Get performance summary

## 💻 Frontend Implementation (React + TypeScript)

- Click to view detailed feedback
- Modal shows:
  - Full score breakdown
  - General feedback
  - Strengths (green box)
  - Areas for improvement (yellow box)
